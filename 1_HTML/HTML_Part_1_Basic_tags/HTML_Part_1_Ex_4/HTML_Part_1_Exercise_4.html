    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p>
        World Poetry Day is celebrated on 21 March, and was declared by UNESCO (the United Nations Educational,
        Scientific
        and
        Cultural Organization) in 1999, "with the aim of supporting linguistic diversity through poetic expression and
        increasing the opportunity for endangered languages to be heard". Its purpose is to promote the reading,
        writing,
        publishing and teaching of poetry throughout the world and, as the original UNESCO declaration says, to "give
        fresh
        recognition and impetus to national, regional and international poetry movements".

        It was generally celebrated in October, but in the latter part of the 20th century the world community
        celebrated it
        on
        the 15th, the birthday of Virgil, the Roman epic poet and poet laureate under Augustus. The tradition to keep an
        October
        date for national or international poetry day celebrations still holds in many countries. The United Kingdom
        generally
        uses the first Thursday in October, but elsewhere a different October, or even sometimes a November date, is
        celebrated.

    <h3> Elevenie </h3>

        An elevenie is a short poem with a given pattern. It contains eleven words which are arranged in a specified
        order
        over
