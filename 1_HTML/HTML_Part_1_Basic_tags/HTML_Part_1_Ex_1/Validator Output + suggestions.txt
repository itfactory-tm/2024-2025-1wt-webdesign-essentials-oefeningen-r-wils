There were 2 messages in the validator: 

Warning: This document appears to be Lorem ipsum text but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="zxx" (or variant) instead.

From line 1, column 16; to line 2, column 16

type html>↩<html lang="en">↩<head

For further guidance, consult Tagging text with no language, Declaring the overall language of a page and Choosing language tags.

If the HTML checker has misidentified the language of this document, please file an issue report or send e-mail to report the problem.

-----

The ZXX language tag means there is no linguistic content, meaning the language is unknown. 

Tags for languages I speak: 
NL:	nl
EN:	en
FR:	fr
DE:	de


The second message in the validator was talking about the viewport meta tag. 
The meta tag was auto-created by the !+TAB feature in the IDE. 
It gives us the recommendation to turn on user-scalable, which is set to "no" at the moment.
